              Silverstone declares itself the home of British racing and with a
              history stretching back to 1948, there is some justification to
              the claim. Always one of the fastest circuits, Silverstone has
              developed from its windswept airfield origins into one of the most
              recognised in world motorsport.
              <br />
              <br />
              It began life in 1943 as RAF Silverstone, home to a unit training
              Wellington pilots in night bombing techniques. At the end of World
              War Two it became surplus to requirements and lay dormant for
              several years. Its first brush with motorsport was strictly
              unofficial; a group of local enthusiasts held an impromptu thrash
              around the abandoned runways in 1947. One of the contingent struck
              a sheep when it wandered onto the site, thereafter leading to the
              day's events being dubbed the Mutton Grand Prix...
              <br />
              <br />
              By the following year, there was official interest in creating a
              circuit from the runways. With Donington Park being used as a
              storage area for the military, Brooklands being owned by Vickers
              Armstrong with its inevitable focus on aircraft and Crystal Palace
              in a state of disrepair, the Royal Automobile Club began searching
              for new venues. With its expanse of runways and perimeter roads,
              Silverstone seemed ideal.
              <br />
              <br />
              In what would turn out to be one of best decisions in motor racing
              administration history, the RAC enlisted James 'Jimmy' Brown to
              organise the first Grand Prix, giving him less than two months to
              make the event a reality. Not only did he pull off a minor
              miracle, Brown remained firmly at the helm for nearly 40 years,
              guiding Silverstone's transformation from austerity to world-class
              facility.
              <br />
              <br />
              So it was that the first Grand Prix was run at the beginning of
              October 1948, though on a significantly different course to what
              would subsequently follow. Using both main runways and part of the
              perimeter roads, the course was laid out with oil barrels and
              straw bales, spectators held back from the track edge by nothing
              more robust than a rope line. Competitors also found themselves
              heading headlong towards each other at top speed where the two
              runways ended with sharp hairpins. The solution? Canvas screens to
              prevent the drivers seeing the possible impending disaster...
              <br />
              <br />
              The event, nonethless, was deemed a success and set Silverstone
              firmly on the motor racing map. From 1949, a switch to the
              permiter roads only was made, albeit with a chicane at Club Corner
              initially. The pit facilities were located between Abbey and
              Woodcote.
              <br />
              <br />
              Significantly, Silverstone was the venue of the first Formula One
              World Championship event, in May 1950. The Queen was there to
              watch – to date the only British event at which a reigning monarch
              has been in attendance – as Dr Giuseppe Farina won for Alfa Romeo.
              <br />
              <br />
              The early years also saw a shorter 'Club' circuit introduced for a
              number of national events for the first time. The Vintage Sports
              Car Club used this variant in 1949, which ran from Copse, through
              Maggots, Becketts and Chapel down to a hairpin and Stowe and along
              the runway back to Copse. The start/finish was just after the
              Stowe hairpin, the course being run in a clockwise direction.
              <br />
              <br />
              From 1952, the British Racing Drivers' Club took over the running
              of the circuit from the RAC and a number of corners saw minor
              revisions and other facilities were generally improved. The pits
              and paddock assumed their familiar location between Woodcote and
              Copse, the start/finish line also moving to this new location
              accordingly.
              <br />
              <br />
              The classic Silverstone layout was now firmly established,
              complete with a new Club Course which ran through Copse and
              Maggotts before turning back on itself just ahead of Becketts and
              running along one of the runways back to Woodcote. Few significant
              circuit layout changes would occur for the next quarter century,
              although gradual improvements to pit and spectator facilities
              continued.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 1961 the BRDC acquired the lease to the agricultural land both
              within and around the circuit, increasing the opportunities for
              future development. After two accidents in the then 'open face'
              pit facilities, a new pit lane – separate from the main track and
              on an elevated platform – was built in 1964, greatly improving
              safety for competitors and their mechanics alike.
              <br />
              <br />
              The BRDC – boosted by the revenues generated by the track – formed
              Silverstone Circuits Limited in 1966, to look after the circuit's
              commercial activities. Five years later, the Club purchased the
              freehold of the entire 720-acre estate from the Ministry of
              Defence.
              <br />
              <br />
              The 1973 British Grand Prix stands out as a significant event in
              Silverstone's history. At the end of the first lap, a youthful
              Jody Scheckter lost control of his McLaren at Woodcote, spinning
              into the pit wall. The chain reaction behind saw a mass pile up
              behind which took out most of the field and was, at the time, the
              biggest crash in F1 history. Amazingly, Andrea de Adamich was the
              only casualty, suffering serious injuries which ultimately would
              end his driving career.
              <br />
              <br />
              The collision also exposed the fact that debris could end up in
              the grandstands and it was clear that changes were needed. The GP
              was held at Brands Hatch in 1974, but by the time the new season
              arrived in 1975, a chicane greeted the racers at Woodcote, as did
              brand new pit garages. The national circuit continued to bypass
              the chicane, as did the motorcycle course.
              <br />
              <br />
              One thing that has always stood Silverstone apart from many other
              circuits is its speed with no slow corners to speak of and long
              straights taken at full throttle, average speeds continued to
              climb. Even the addition of the chicane at Woodcote did little to
              abate the high-velocity charge. By the time of the turbo era in
              F1, cars were passing through the chicane faster than their
              predecessors had managed through the original corner...
              <br />
              <br />
              What's in a name? Some of Silverstone's corner names seem
              straightforward, others are less obvious. Here's what they are
              really named after:
              <br />
              <br />
              Abbey and Luffield - Luffield Abbey, the remains of which were
              discovered 200 metres from Stowe Corner.
              <br />
              Becketts and Chapel Curve - the ruins of the Chapel of Thomas
              Becket lie close to the circuit (the BRDC changed the spelling for
              the corner name though!).
              <br />
              Stowe Corner - Stowe School is less than two miles south of the
              circuit
              <br />
              Maggotts - a local landmark, Maggotts Moor field, which is next to
              the circuit
              <br />
              Copse - a small wood which used to sit adjacent to the corner
              <br />
              Club Corner - in honour of the RAC Club, Pall Mall
              <br />
              Woodcote - in honour of the country club at Woodcote Park in
              Surrey
              <br />
              Hangar Straight - two aircraft hangars originally lined the
              circuit here
              <br />
              Hamilton Straight - named by the circuit in December 2020 in
              honour of the acheivements of Sir Lewis Hamilton, seven times
              World Formula One Champion.
              <br />
              Village - commemorates Silverstone village
              <br />
              Ireland - Innes Ireland, grand prix driver and President of the
              BRDC, 1992-93
              <br />
              Wellington Straight - Vickers Wellington bombers were based at RAF
              Silverstone
              <br />
              Brooklands - the world's first purpose-built circuit at Weybridge,
              Surrey.
              <br />
              The Loop - simply refers to the corner shape
              <br />
              <br />
              Things came to a head in 1985, when Keke Rosberg set a 160mph
              average lap speed in qualifying (despite a slow puncture) and
              three other cars posted laps of more than 159mph. By the time the
              F1 stars arrived for 1987 - the race again skipping a year at
              Brands Hatch - dramatic changes had been made to Woodcote. The
              S-bend chicane was removed and replaced by a new sharp left-right
              bend on the approach. In addition, more than £1 million was spent
              replacing the 1975 pits with 40 much larger garages, topped by an
              all-new press centre that would be completed by the 1988 Grand
              Prix.
              <br />
              <br />
              The changes also allowed the introduction of a longer 'National'
              course, which utilised a new right hand turn off the Club Straight
              (later named Brooklands) and right hander onto the chicane,
              forming what became known as the Luffield Complex. The Club
              circuit remained unchanged.
              <br />
              <br />
              Further significant redevelopment happened over the winter of
              1990, designed to take the circuit through the 1990s. The run off
              at Copse was increased by tightening the entry and re-routing the
              corner, while the original Becketts corner was by passed with a
              sweeping – and high speed – series of corners forming a new
              Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel Curve sequence, which drew universal
              praise.
              <br />
              <br />
              Hangar Straight was unchanged, save for the addition of a traffic
              bridge, but Stowe was slowed and tightened into a fourth gear
              turn, before the track diverted off into the new Vale complex and
              a left-right flick back onto Club. The cars were, as a
              consequence, slower through an unchanged Abbey, before swooping
              under the bridge and right through a new high-speed corner, up to
              the left-hander at Priory and back onto the Brooklands/Luffield
              complex before Woodcote, minus the need for the chicane, completed
              the lap.
              <br />
              <br />
              Further track revisions came in 1994 after the deaths of Ayrton
              Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola and a testing crash for
              Pedro Lamy at Silverstone saw a renewed focus on circuit safety.
              Copse was further re-aligned to increase run-off, while a new and
              slower Stowe was constructed. The entry to Club was also tightened
              and a new chicane inserted at Abbey. Priory corner was diverted,
              turning in earlier than previously and leading to a hairpin-like
              corner at Brooklands.
              <br />
              <br />A new South Course was created, running from Abbey back
              round to Chapel Curve, which could be run simultaneously with the
              National or Club circuits, though with no pit facilities to speak
              of was only used for school use or testing purposes.
              <br />
              <br />
              More alterations were made in 1996, when a better solution was
              found for Stowe Corner; by adding a gradual kink towards the end
              of the Hangar Straight and moving the track towards the infield,
              greater room was created for run-off and a faster Stowe could once
              again be restored. Another new addition at this part of the track
              was the self-contained Stowe circuit. Utilising some of the
              original runways near to the Vale complex, the new triangular
              course offered excellent and safe facilities for the Silverstone
              Racing School.
              <br />
              <br />
              Also new was the International course. This turned right after
              Maggots, through a fast chicane at Ireland and onto the South
              course, before turning back on itself at Abbey through a 180
              degree hairpin. It became one of the most-used circuits, with many
              national championships preferring it to the longer Grand Prix
              circuit.
              <br />
              <br />
              Further significant investments were brought forward a year when a
              new Priory/Brooklands/Luffield complex was unveiled. Much more
              satisfying to drive, its design featured input from the drivers
              themselves. A small change was made to the International course as
              well, when the Ireland chicane was bypassed (although motorcycle
              racers continued to use it).
              <br />
              <br />
              Infrastructure changes around the circuit improved access, with a
              four lane entry road completed in 2002 as an ancillary project to
              the joining of the M1 and M40 motorways nearby.
              <br />
              <br />
              Thereafter the next significant changes came in 2003, this time at
              the behest of the World Superbike racers. Speeds through Woodcote
              proved a concern and a new tighter loop at Luffield and clumsy
              flip-flop chicane was inserted, which undoubtedly slowed speeds,
              but was never wildly popular.
              <br />
              <br />
              Uncertainty over the future of the Formula One race (which had
              flirted with plans to race first at a redeveloped Brands Hatch and
              then committed to Donington Park) led to Silverstone bosses begin
              to look elsewhere for its headline event. Plans to bring back the
              MotoGP racers for the first time since 1986 were hatched, and with
              it a much revised circuit. When Donington Park's F1 bid fell
              through in financial acrimony a new F1 deal was signed and the
              planned circuit works modified.
              <br />
              <br />
              To accommodate Bernie Ecclestone's demands, a new Wing-like pit
              and paddock complex was to be built between Copse and Abbey, with
              the circuit swooping infields to a new 'Arena' complex before
              rejoining the existing circuit on the former Club Straight, now
              renamed in honour of the Wellington bombers which once took off
              along it.
              <br />
              <br />
              The new course debuted in 2010, although work to complete the new
              pit complex was completed in time for the 2011 Grand Prix. This
              has led to the circuit having alternative start and finish
              locations – F1 uses the 'Wing' pits, while most other
              championships tend to use the original pits and start/finish
              locations.
              <br />
              <br />A new International circuit using the southern half of the
              Grand Prix circuit could now be used independently thanks to the
              Wing pits, it has yet to secure any major racing action, while the
              National circuit has gained greater prominence once again,
              especially as the venue for the annual rounds of the British
              Touring Car Championship.
              <br />
              <br />
              While the old track from through to Bridge and Priory still
              remains, circuit bosses officially decommissioned it in 2011 and
              it now forms a picnic area.
